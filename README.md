# Resume Screening AI System

## Project Overview
This project is an AI-powered Resume Screening System developed under the **AICTE Internship on AI**, part of **TechSaksham**, a joint CSR initiative by **Microsoft & SAP**. It automates resume categorization, job recommendation, and information extraction using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Key Features
### 1. **Resume Parsing**
   - Extracts key details such as **contact information, skills, education, and work experience** from resumes (PDF/TXT formats).
   
### 2. **Resume Categorization**
   - Uses machine learning algorithms to classify resumes into predefined categories based on industry and role suitability.

### 3. **Job Recommendations**
   - Provides AI-driven job recommendations based on extracted information and matching job roles.

## Benefits
âœ… **Time Efficiency** - Reduces manual resume screening efforts.
âœ… **Unbiased Screening** - Ensures a fair evaluation based on skills and experience.
âœ… **Enhanced Candidate Matching** - Helps candidates find suitable jobs faster.
âœ… **Seamless Automation** - NLP-based parsing for structured resume analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Flask for backend processing)
- **Machine Learning** (Random Forest Classifier for categorization & recommendation)
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** (TF-IDF Vectorization, Regex-based information extraction)
- **PyPDF2** (Extracts text from PDFs)
- **HTML, CSS** (Frontend UI with a futuristic design)

## How It Works
1. **Upload Resume** (PDF/TXT format)
2. **AI Processing** - System extracts, categorizes, and analyzes the resume.
3. **Results Displayed** - Shows extracted details, category, and recommended jobs.

## Deployment
This project is built using **Flask** and can be deployed locally or on cloud platforms like **AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud**.

## Acknowledgment
This project is developed under the **AICTE Internship on AI**, as part of **TechSaksham**, a CSR initiative by **Microsoft & SAP**, aimed at empowering students with AI & ML skills.
